- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Atropy, or also known irl as Eduardo. I'm an aspiring beginner programmer coming from this shitass country that I call Brazil.

- ðŸŽ“ I'm currently coursing third year on IT in EEEP Venceslau Vieira Batista, a professional school public school ranging from Ceara, on a small town. And I plan
to reach University on Computer Science or some general branch of Mechanical Engineering (I don't know exactly Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯), I'll probably end up as a Software Engineer
however...

- ðŸ“– I have been living and breathing on computer almost my whole life, even if I'm very young, and I plan to continue doing so for my future as a career option. I
Also love reading, puzzles and learning about Astronomy. 

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and PHP and plan to reach over to C# and maybe something else along the way.

- ðŸ“­ You can contact me by my email: ed.wardolivacap@gmail.com
